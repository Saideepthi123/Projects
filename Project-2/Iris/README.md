# Introduction
The Iris dataset is a classic dataset for classification, machine learning, and data visualization.

The dataset contains: 3 classes (different Iris species) with 50 samples each

Features : Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width. 

Target variable: Different Species of Iris plant.

One species, Iris Setosa, is "linearly separable" from the other two. This means that we can draw a line                                                                           
(or a hyperplane in higher-dimensional spaces) between Iris Setosa samples and samples corresponding to the other two species                                                                                                                                                                    
# Purpose
The purpose of this project was to gain introductory exposure to Machine Learning Classification concepts along with data visualization.
